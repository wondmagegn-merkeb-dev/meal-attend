// This file can be removed or repurposed as Prisma now generates these types.
// For components that need a specific subset, you can define it here.
// Example:
// import type { UserActivityLog as PrismaActivityLog } from '@prisma/client';
// export type ActivityLogViewModel = Pick<PrismaActivityLog, 'id' | 'action' | 'details' | 'activityTimestamp'>;

// For now, we will rely on importing the full type directly from '@prisma/client' where needed.
